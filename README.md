## Introduction

Geospatial data plays a critical role in a myriad of applications, ranging from urban planning and environmental monitoring to transportation and disaster response. With the power of Machine Learning and GeoPandas, the capability of extracting insights, predicting trends, and understanding patterns from geospatial data is amplified.

This project aims to guide you through the steps and techniques required to harness the potential of geospatial machine learning.

## Dependencies

To ensure smooth execution and analysis, this project relies on several packages. Here are the key libraries used:

- `geopandas`
- `pandas`
- `folium`
- `matplotlib`
- `mapclassify`

## Installation

To get started, you must first ensure that all required packages are installed. If you encounter the error:


You can resolve it by installing the necessary packages via either `conda` or `pip`:

**Using conda:**
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge folium matplotlib mapclassify

**Using pip:**
```bash
pip install folium matplotlib mapclassifyContributing
